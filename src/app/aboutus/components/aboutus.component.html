Geez always had a notch for DJing since he was a little kid break dancing on his head, and listening to the Philly DJ's while growing up. DJ Rick Geez was heavily influenced by DJ Jay Ski, Cosmik Kev, DJ Ran and a slew of other DJ's that were on Power99 & Q102 in Philly in the 80's and early 90's. In 1994 when Rick received his first mixer he knew at that moment that he wanted to make Djing his profession. He taught himself how to scratch by watching DJs that came before him and that he looked up to."></Span>
